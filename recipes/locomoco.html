    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Loco Moco is a Hawaiian favorite featuring white rice topped with a burger patty, gravy, and finished with a fried egg. Although there are variations of this beloved breakfast and lunch staple, this easy recipe hits the mark perfectly. With an umami mushroom and onion gravy, it's super hearty and flavorful. Tastes just like a trip to Hawaii!</p>

    <p>This authentic Hawaiian Loco Moco recipe is crazy good! The beef patty is super flavorful. A fried egg, complete with runny yolk, is the figurative icing on the cake.</p>

    <p>Although I'm not the biggest fan of plain, sticky, steamed white rice, Asian-inspired loco moco gravy with mushrooms and onions soaks into the rice, giving it tons of flavor.</p>
        
    <p>Making homemade loco moco is a quite easy, and significantly cheaper than a plane ticket. If a trip to Hawaii is not in the cards right now, this recipe will definitely satisfy the craving for traditional Hawaiian flavors. Aloha!</p>
