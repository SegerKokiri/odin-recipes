    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>BLT stands for Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato. Ok, ok, so we snuck in some avocado which makes it a BALT, but once you try this iconic sandwich with avocado, there is no going back. Everyone loves the flavor profile of an authentic BLT which is why we now have a BLT Salad and even a Breakfast BLT Sandwich.</p>

    <p>We fell in love with this sandwich sauce when we tried the Chicken Bacon Avocado Sandwich at Kneaders restaurant. I asked for an extra side of sauce, took it home, and re-created it.</p>

    <p>Itâ€™s just 3 ingredients and the combination is memorable: mayonnaise, sour cream, and a little bit of yellow mustard. Try it on your next BLT and you will have a new favorite.</p>
